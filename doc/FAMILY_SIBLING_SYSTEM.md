# Family ID & Sibling System - Implementation Guide

## 📋 Overview
Successfully implemented a complete Family ID and Sibling management system with support for both **Blood Siblings** and **Cousins**.

---

## 🗄️ Database Changes

### New Tables Created:
1. **families** - Tracks family units
   - `family_id` (Primary Key) - Format: FAM-YYYY-NNNN
   - `family_name`, `primary_contact_name`, `primary_contact_phone`
   - `notes`, `created_at`

2. **student_siblings** - Explicit sibling relationships
   - Links two students with relation type
   - Prevents duplicate relationships
   - `relation_type`: 'blood' or 'cousin'

### Students Table Updates:
- **family_id** column added - Links students to family
- **sibling_relation** column - Default: 'blood'
- Indexed for fast family lookups
