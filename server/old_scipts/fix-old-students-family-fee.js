/**
 * fix-old-students-family-fee.js
 * Migration: Ensure ALL existing students are correctly migrated to the
 * family fee system. Run once from server/ directory.
 *
 * What it does:
 *  1. Creates missing `families` records for every unique family_id in students
 *  2. For multi-member families where family_fee = 0, seeds it from SUM of members' monthly_fee
 *  3. Reports families that still need manual fee entry
 *  4. Reports solo-student families (no action needed — they use individual monthly_fee)
